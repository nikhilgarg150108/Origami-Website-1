        <ul><i>
            <li>Camels are also known as the "Ship of the Desert" as they are an effective means of transport in the sandy areas.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Camels have adapted very well to the hot desert climate. They store food and water in their hump and utilize it if there is scarcity of water.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Camels have padded feet so that they don't sink in the sand. Their eyes are well-protected against the blowing sand.</li>
        </i></ul>

            <img src="images/chameleon.png" width=300 height=300/>

        <p>Did You Know?</p>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Chamelions can camouflage themselves and change their colour to the colour of the surface on which they stand.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Chamelions use this ability to hide from predators and cath their prey easily.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Chamelions can see in 2 directions at the same time as both their eyes can move seperately.</li>
        </i></ul>

        <a href="http://origami.me/panda/">
            <img src="images/panda.png" width=300 height=300/>
        </a>
        <p>Did You Know?</p>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Giant pandas are born looking like baby badgers â€” fur-less, pink, and blind. The iconic black and white colour comes later, after about three weeks.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>A 45-kilo adult panda spends as long as 14 hours eating. And it can eat 12 to 38 kilos of bamboo a day.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Pandas have a 6th "digit" on the heels of their fore-paws. With their extra "thumbs" they can manoeuvre the bamboo into fat cigar shapes for efficient eating.</li>
        </i></ul>

        <a href="http://origami.me/pigeon/">
            <img src="images/pigeon.png" width=300 height=300/>
        </a>
        <p>Did You Know?</p>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Pigeons have an excellent navigational skill. Before telecommunication and postbox were invented, pigeons were often used to carry messages and letters.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Pigeons and humans have lived in close proximity for thousands of years. The first recordings of this date back to Mesopotamis, modern Iraq, in 3000 BCE.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>
        </i></ul>

        <a href="http://origami.me/flying-cicada/">
            <img src="images/cicada.png" width=300 height=300/>
        </a>
        <p>Did You Know?</p>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Male cicadas sing to attract the females. They are one of the loudest insects in the world. Some sing as loudly as a power saw, which is enough to cause permanent hearing loss if it was right next to your ear.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Cicada nymphs dring sap using a 'rostrum'. A rostrum is like 2 straws in 1. The cicada spits saliva down 1 straw to break up and dissolve tree roots, then uses the other straw to suck it back up.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Cicadas have one of the longest insect life spans. An annual cicada can live between two and five years, and a periodical cicada can live for up to 17 years in the larva stage.</li>
        </i></ul>

        <p>Did You Know?</p>
        <ul><i>
            <li>The teddy bear toy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>A teddy has been into space! Magellan T Bear boarded Space Shuttle Discovery in 1995 as part of a school project.</li>
        </i></ul>
        <ul><i>
            <li>Older teddy bears, that were created in the early 20th century, actually looked like real bears! They had long noses, dark eyes, and were very bear-shaped.</li>
        </i></ul>
